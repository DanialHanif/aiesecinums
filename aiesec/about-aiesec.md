## The name "AIESEC"

AIESEC was originally a french acronym for:

> _Association internationale des étudiants en sciences économiques et commerciales_

Or in English:

> _International Association of Students in Economic and Commercial Sciences_

But the full name is no longer used as it is now opened for all students from any university background.
